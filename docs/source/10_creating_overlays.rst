Creating Overlays
==============================================

Introduction
--------------
As described in the introduction section, overlays are analogous to software libraries. A programmer can download overlays into the Zynq PL at runtime to provide functionality  required by the software application. The overlay could consist of an interface that supports external peripherals, or an accelerator that could help speed up the software application running on the PS. 

A PYNQ overlay will have a Python interface, allowing a software programmer to use it like any other Python package. 

Overlays are classes of Programmable Logic design. Programmable Logic designs are usually highly optimized for a specific task. Overlays however, are designed to be configurable, and reusabe for broad set of applications. While a programmer can use an overlay, creating an overlay is a specialised task for a hardware designer. 

This document will give an overview of the process of creating an overlay and integrating it into PYNQ, but will not cover the hardware design process in detail. 


Programmable Logic
---------------------------

An overlay consists of two main parts; the overlay Programmable Logic (PL) design, and the Python API. 

Xilinx Vivado software is used to create the hardware design, and generate the bitstream (.bit file) that is used to program the Zynq PL.  

The free webpack version of Vivado supports the PYNQ-Z1 board, and can be used to create PYNQ overlays.

https://www.xilinx.com/products/design-tools/vivado/vivado-webpack.html

There are some differences between standard Zynq designs, and designing PYNQ overlays. A standard Vivado project for a Zynq design consists of two parts; the PL design, and the PS configuration settings. The PS configuration includes settings for system clocks, including the clocks used in the PL. 

The PYNQ image which is used to boot the board configures the Zynq PS. Overlays will be downloaded at runtime, after the PS has been configured. This means that overlay designers should ensure the PS settings in their Vivado project match the PYNQ image settings. 

The following settings should be used for a new Vivado overlay project: 

Vivado Project settings:
* Target device: xc7z020clg400-1

PL clock configuration:

* FCLK_CLK0: 100.00MHz
* FCLK_CLK1: 142.86MHz
* FCLK_CLK2: 200.00MHz
* FCLK_CLK3: 166.67MHz

The PYNQ-Z1 Master XDC (I/O constraints) are available at the Digilent PYNQ-Z1 resource site:
https://reference.digilentinc.com/reference/programmable-logic/pynq-z1/start

It is recommended to start with an existing overlay design to ensure the PS settings are correct. 

The tcl for the Vivado block diagram should also be exported with the bitstream. This allows information about the overlay to be parsed into Python. See the next section for details on how to query the tcl file. 

To generate the Block Diagram tcl in Vivado:

File > Export > Block Design to export the tcl file to be included with the Overlay. 

Or, run the following in the tcl console:

   .. code-block::console
   
      write_bd_tcl
      
The tcl filename should match the .bit filename. E.g. my_overlay.bit and my_overlay.tcl

An error will be displayed if a tcl is not available when attempting to download an overlay, or if the tcl filename does not match the .bit file name.

Overlay tcl
-----------------------------------

The Overlay package has a built in ip_dict() method to identify IPs in a specific overlay (e.g. `base.bit`): 


To show the IP dictionary of the overlay, run the following:

.. code-block:: python

   from pynq import Overlay
   OL = Overlay("base.bit")
   OL.ip_dict

Each entry in this IP dictionary that is returned is a key-value pair. 
E.g.: 

    ``'SEG_mb_bram_ctrl_1_Mem0': ['0x40000000', '0x10000', None]``

Note, that this queries the tcl that was used to built the design, not the overlay running in the PL. 
    
The key of the entry is the IP instance name; all the IP instance names are parsed from the `*.tcl` file (e.g. `base.tcl`) in the address segment section. The value of the entry is a list of 3 items:

   - The first item shows the base address of the addressable IP (hex).
   - The second item shows the address range in bytes (hex).
   - The third item records the state associated with the IP. It is `None` by default, but can be used flexibly by the users.


   
Similarly, the PL package can be used to find the addressable IPs currently in the programmable logic:

.. code-block:: python

   from pynq import PL
   PL.ip_dict

The ip_dict() method can be useful to reference an IP by name in your Python code, rather than by a hard coded address, or to check overlays for specific IPs. 


Existing Overlays
-----------------

One overlay is currently included in the Pynq repository; *base*:

   * ``<GitHub repository>/Pynq-Z1/vivado/base``
  
A makefile exists in each folder that can be used to rebuild the Vivado project and generate the bitstream for the overlay. The bitstream and tcl for the overlay are available on the board (base.bit is loaded by default when the board boots), and in the project repository ``<GitHub Repository>/Pynq-Z1/bitstream/``.

Vivado must be installation to design and build overlays. Building an existing overlay design allows the project to be opened in Vivado and examined, or modified to create a new overlay.

Interfacing to the overlay
================================
   
MMIO
------
  
PYNQ includes the *MMIO* Python class to simplify communication beween the Zynq PS and PL. Once the overlay has been created, and the memory map is known, the *MMIO* can be used to access memory mapped locations in the PL. 

The Python code for the MMIO can be viewed here:

    ``<GitHub Repository>/python/pynq/mmio.py``

The MMIO class can access an area of memory in the PL by specifying the start address, and the range. E.g. The following code allows access to memory mapped locations in the PL from 0x40000000 to 0x40010000 (`SEG_mb_bram_ctrl_1_Mem0`): 

.. code-block:: python

   from pynq import MMIO

   # an IP is located at 0x40000000
   myip = MMIO(0x40000000,0x10000)

   # Read from the IP at offset 0
   myip.read(0)


In the example above, any accesses outside the address range 0x10000 (65535 bytes) will cause an error in the Python package. The designer must be careful to ensure that locations accessed from Python have something mapped in the PL. Remember that custom peripherals exist in the address space, and even if and address range is mapped by the MMIO, there may not be anything connected to specific addresses, or they may be read only or write only. Invalid accesses to the PL may cause system errors.

When creating the python driver for a new hardware function, the MMIO can be wrapped inside a Python module. 

CFFI
----------

C functions inside a shared library can be called from Python using the C Foreign Function Interface (CFFI).

For more information on CFFI and shared libraries refer to:

http://cffi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview.html

http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Program-Library-HOWTO/shared-libraries.html
  
   
To get examples on how to use CFFI, refer to the CMA class or the Audio class, both located in pynq/drivers.

Memory Management
---------------------

The pynq package xlnk can allocate contiguous memory. Contiguous memory is required when using non-scatter-gather DMAs.

Allocate ad free contiguous memory with 

.. code-block:: python
   cma_alloc()
   cma_free()
   
   cma_stats() # Get the amount of contiguous free memory. 

For more information on the xlnk class refer to the memory management example notebook.

Packaging overlays
====================

An overlay, tcl, and Python can be placed anywhere in the filesystem, but this is not good practice. 

The default location for the base PYNQ overlay and tcl is : 
   
   ``<GitHub Repository>/Pynq-Z1/bitstream``

The PYNQ Python can be found here:

   ``<GitHub Repository>/python/pynq``

You can fork PYNQ from github, and add Python code to the PYNQ package. However, for custom overlays, you can create your own repository and package it to allow other users to install your overlay using pip.

There are different ways to package a project for installation with pip. One example is provided below. 

See pip install for more details, and more packaging options.
https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_install

   
The following example assume an overlay that exists in the root of a GitHub repository.

Assume the repository has the following structure:

An example project layout could be:
   
   * notebook/
      * new_overlay.ipynb
   * new_overlay/
      * new_overlay.bit
      * new_overlay.tcl
      * __init.py
      * new_overlay.py
   readme.md
   license   
   
   
Add a setup.py to the root of your repository. This file will imports the necessary packages, and specifies some setup instructions for your package including the package name, version, url, and files to include. 

Example setup.py : 

.. code-block :: python

   from setuptools import setup, find_packages
   import subprocess
   import sys
   import shutil
   import new_overlay

   setup(
       name = "new_overlay",
       version = new_overlay.__version__,
       url = 'https://github.com/your_github/new_overlay',
       license = 'All rights reserved.',
       author = "Your Name",
       author_email = "your@email.com",
       packages = ['new_overlay'],
       package_data = {
       '' : ['*.bit','*.tcl','*.py','*.so'],
       },
       description = "New custom overlay for PYNQ-Z1"
   )

**package_data** specifies which files will be installed as part of the package.
   
   
From a terminal, the new package can be installed by running:

.. code-block :: console

   sudo pip install --upgrade 'git+https://github.com/your_github/new_overlay'
   
   
   
Using Overlays
----------------

The PL can be dynamically reconfigured with new overlays as the system is running. 

Loading overlays can be done in Python using the Overlay class:

   ``<GitHub Repository>/python/pynq/pl.py``
   
The bitstream can then be downloaded from Python:

.. code-block:: python

   from pynq import Overlay
   ol = Overlay("base.bit")
   ol.download()

   
Using new overlays with GPIO
-----------------------------------
GPIO between the Zynq PS and PL can be used by Python code as a control interface to overlays.  The information about a GPIO is kept in the GPIO dictionary of an overlay. 

The following code can be used to get the dictionary for a bitstream:

.. code-block:: python

   from pynq import Overlay
   ol = Overlay("base.bit")
   ol.gpio_dict


A GPIO dictionary entry is a key, value pair, where *value* is a list of two items. An example of the entry in a GPIO dictionary:

    ``'mb_1_reset/Din': [0, None]``

The key is the GPIO instance name (*mb_1_reset/Din*). GPIO instance names are read and parsed from the Vivado `*.tcl` file (e.g. `base.tcl`). 

The *value* is a list of 2 items:

  - The first item shows the index of the GPIO (0).
  - The second item (*None*) shows the state of the GPIO. It is `None` by default, but can be user defined.

The following code can be used to get the dictionary for GPIO currently in the FPGA fabric:

.. code-block:: python

   from pynq import PL
   pl = PL
   pl.gpio_dict
