1. Set the boot jumper to SD and the power jumper to USB, insert the Micro SD card into the board. Connect the USB cable (Micro-B), and Ethernet cable

2. Connect the USB cable to your computer or a powered USB port, and the Ethernet cable to your router/switch or directly to your computer 

3. Power on the board, and wait ~30s for the board to boot (the two colour LEDs flash blue, and the four yellow/green user LEDs will flash and stay on when the board is ready)

4. Open a browser and go to `http://pynq:9090 <http://pynq:9090>`_ (if the board is connected to your network) or  `http://192.168.2.99:9090 <http://192.168.2.99:9090>`_ (if connected directly to your computer). You may need to configure your Ethernet adapter to the same IP range for a direct connection.
